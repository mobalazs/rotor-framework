**Rotor** is a modular, ViewModel-first UI framework for Roku applications built with BrighterScript and SceneGraph. It is lightweight and designed to intuitively speed up development time while simplifying both the implementation and long-term maintenance process. It features a rich ViewBuilder system and a Roku-friendly implementation of the MVI (Model-View-Intent) design pattern. It helps developers structure large-scale apps with reusable components, state-driven logic, and optimized rendering â€” all without relying on traditional XML-based views.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

* **ViewBuilder system**: Declarative and extensible view construction with a flexible, code-based template system, automatic full lifecycle management, and a virtual node tree abstraction.
* **Roku-friendly MVI design pattern**: Predictable state, clear separation of concerns, and cross-thread compatibility.
* **Component-based UI**: Isolated, reusable UI widgets and view models.
* **i18n support**: Locale-aware interface with flexible language resource injection.
* **Integrated Animate Library**: [https://github.com/haystacknews/animate](https://github.com/haystacknews/animate)

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Rotor is structured as a shared library for Brighterscript projects. To install:

1. Copy the `source/rotor` directory into your project.
2. Import Rotor in your main file:

```vb
import "pkg:/source/rotor/RotorFramework.bs"
```

---

## âš¡ Quick Start

```vb

frameworkInstance = new Rotor.Framework()

frameworkInstance.render([
    {
        id: "helloLabel", ' optional
        nodeType: "Label",
        fields: {
            text: "Hello World!",
            color: "#CCCCCC"
        }
    }
])

```

This minimalist example initializes the framework and displays a label on screen. This minimal setup fully initializes the ViewBuilder and demonstrates its core rendering capabilities. You can find many more examples and capabilities in the detailed documentation.
