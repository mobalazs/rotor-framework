**Rotor** is a modular, ViewModel-first UI framework for Roku applications built with BrighterScript and SceneGraph. It is lightweight and designed to intuitively speed up development time while simplifying both the implementation and long-term maintenance process. It features a rich ViewBuilder system and a Roku-friendly implementation of the MVI (Model-View-Intent) design pattern. It helps developers structure large-scale apps with reusable components, state-driven logic, and optimized rendering.

-   **ViewBuilder system**: Declarative and extensible view construction with a flexible, code-based template system, automatic full lifecycle management, and a virtual node tree abstraction.
-   **Roku-friendly MVI design pattern**: Predictable state, clear separation of concerns, and cross-thread compatibility.
-   **Component-based UI**: Isolated, reusable UI widgets and view models.
-   **i18n support**: Locale-aware interface with flexible language resource injection.

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

Rotor Framework requires BrighterScript v1. Install the latest version:

```bash
npm install --save-dev brighterscript@next @rokucommunity/bslint@next
```

### Install Rotor Framework

**Manual installation:**

1. Download the latest `rotor-framework.zip` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/mobalazs/rotor-framework/releases)
2. Extract the ZIP into your project's `source/` directory (this will create a `rotor-framework/` folder)
3. Import Rotor in your main file:

**ROPM install:**

-   **Note:** You must install without prefix by adding this to `package.json`
-   Don't worry everything is in the `Rotor` namespace by default, so this is the only name reserved by the framework.

```bash
ropm install rotor-framework
```

```json
"ropm": {
    "noprefix": ["rotor-framework"]
}
```

## ⚡ Quick usage

```vb
import "pkg:/source/RotorFramework.bs"

frameworkInstance = new Rotor.Framework()

frameworkInstance.render([
    {
        id: "helloLabel", ' optional
        nodeType: "Label",
        fields: {
            text: "Hello World!",
            color: "#CCCCCC"
        }
    }
])
```
