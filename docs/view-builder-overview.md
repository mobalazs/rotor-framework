# ViewBuilder Overview

[‚Üê README.md](../README.md#-learn-more) | [üå±](./ai/view-builder-overview.opt.yaml)

The Rotor ViewBuilder provides a declarative way to build Roku SceneGraph UIs entirely from BrightScript code‚Äîwithout XML. This document provides a high-level overview of the ViewBuilder architecture and its core concepts.

## Architecture

![ViewBuilder Architecture](images/Rotor_Framework_ViewBuilder.jpeg)

The ViewBuilder system consists of three main layers:
## Core Engine (Under-the-hood insight)

### 1. View Builder 

The View Builder is responsible for the complete lifecycle management of widgets and ViewModels:

- **Create widgets** - Instantiate and configure new UI components
- **Remove widgets** - Clean up and destroy components
- **Update widgets** - Modify existing component properties

All widgets are registered with a unique identifier and organized in a **Hierarchical Identifier (HID)** system that tracks the widget tree structure.

### 2. Virtual Node Tree

The Virtual Node Tree is an abstraction layer that represents the entire UI hierarchy:

- Maintains a hierarchy of widgets and ViewModels
- Each ViewModel extends Widget and can contain multiple child widgets
- Provides efficient lookup and navigation through the widget tree
- Manages parent-child relationships automatically

### 3. Plugins

Plugins extend widget functionality and are invoked on-demand based on configuration:

- **Observer Plugin** - Field observation and change callbacks
- **Dispatcher Plugin** - State management integration
- **Fields Plugin** - Dynamic field expressions and interpolation
- **Font Style Plugin** - Typography and font configuration
- **Focus Plugin** - Spatial navigation and focus management

All plugins follow the same lifecycle hooks (beforeMount, beforeUpdate, beforeDestroy) and can extend or decorate widgets with additional capabilities.

## Core Concepts

### Widget

A **Widget** is the smallest unit in the UI tree, representing a single SceneGraph node.

- Configured through declarative object properties
- Can have child widgets
- Supports all plugin extensions
- Automatically receives framework methods for navigation and state management

### ViewModel

A **ViewModel** extends Widget to group multiple widgets with shared state and behavior:

- **Shared `props`** - Read-only configuration accessible to all child widgets
- **Shared `viewModelState`** - Mutable state accessible to all child widgets
- **Template method** - Returns the widget tree configuration
- **Lifecycle hooks** - onCreateView, onTemplateCreated, onUpdateView, onDestroyView

All widgets within a ViewModel can access the same `props` and `viewModelState` references, enabling coordinated UI updates without prop drilling.

## How It Works

1. **Widget Registration** - Widgets are created and added to the Virtual Node Tree with unique HIDs
2. **Plugin Decoration** - Based on configuration, plugins extend widgets with additional functionality
3. **Hierarchy Building** - Parent-child relationships are established in the virtual tree
4. **SceneGraph Rendering** - Virtual widgets are materialized as actual SceneGraph nodes
5. **Lifecycle Management** - Framework manages mount, update, and destroy operations automatically

The Virtual Node Tree acts as a single source of truth, allowing the framework to efficiently track changes and update only the necessary SceneGraph nodes.

## Key Benefits

- **No XML Required** - Build entire UIs in BrightScript with full IDE support
- **Declarative API** - Describe what you want, not how to build it
- **Automatic Lifecycle** - Framework handles mounting, updating, and cleanup
- **Plugin Architecture** - Extend functionality without modifying core code
- **Virtual Tree Abstraction** - Efficient updates and lookups
- **Shared State** - ViewModels provide scoped state sharing without prop drilling
