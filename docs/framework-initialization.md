# Framework Initialization

[‚Üê README.md](../README.md#-learn-more) | [üå±](./ai/framework-initialization.opt.yaml)

## Overview

The Rotor Framework is initialized by creating an instance of the `Rotor.Framework` class. This main orchestrator sets up the entire framework ecosystem including the ViewBuilder, internationalization service, dispatcher provider, animation system, and plugin architecture.

## Basic Initialization

```brightscript
' Minimal initialization
framework = new Rotor.Framework()

' With configuration
framework = new Rotor.Framework({
    tasks: ["DataTask", "NetworkTask"],
    rootNode: m.top,
    readyFieldId: "appReady",
    onReady: sub()
        print "Framework ready!"
    end sub
})
```

## Configuration Options

### Core Configuration

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `rootNode` | roSGNode | No | Root SceneGraph node for the framework. Defaults to `top` node if not specified. |
| `tasks` | array | No | List of task node names to synchronize with the render thread. When specified, the render queue waits for all tasks to signal ready before flushing. |
| `onReady` | function | No | Callback function invoked after tasks are synced and the render queue is flushed. Called in global scope. |
| `readyFieldId` | string | No | Field name to add to the root node that will be set to `true` after tasks are synced and render queue is flushed. Useful for triggering observers. |
| `nodePool` | array | No | Array of node pool configurations for pre-instantiating SceneGraph nodes. Supports: Group, Rectangle, Poster, Label. Format: `[{ nodeType: "Label", count: 50 }]` |
| `plugins` | array | No | List of plugin instances to register. Default plugins are automatically included. Custom plugins are not documented yet. |
| `debug` | object | No | Debug configuration options. |

### Debug Options

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `debug.autoSetNodeId` | boolean | false | Automatically set node IDs for debugging purposes. |

## Task Synchronization

When building applications with background tasks, you often need to wait for those tasks to initialize before rendering the UI. The framework provides built-in task synchronization.

### Why Task Synchronization?

- **Cross-thread initialization**: Ensure task threads are ready before the render thread proceeds
- **State management**: Wait for initial state to be loaded from tasks before rendering
- **Predictable startup**: Guarantee a specific initialization order across threads

### How It Works with the Render Queue

The ViewBuilder itself executes **synchronously**, but the framework uses an **internal render queue** to manage timing with task synchronization. This means you don't need to worry about timing when calling `render()`:

**Key Points:**
- You can call `render()` immediately after framework instantiation, even before tasks are synchronized
- Render calls are queued internally and maintain their order
- If tasks are not yet synced, the render queue waits automatically
- Once all tasks signal ready, the framework flushes the render queue in order
- The `onReady` callback fires after the queue is flushed

**Bypassing the Queue with `enableRenderBeforeReady`:**

If you need to render UI **immediately** without waiting for task synchronization, you can pass `{ enableRenderBeforeReady: true }` as the last parameter to `render()`. This bypasses the render queue and executes the render operation immediately.

```brightscript
' Render immediately, bypassing the queue
m.framework.render({
    id: "MyStaticAsset",
    viewModel: ViewModels.MyStaticAsset
}, { enableRenderBeforeReady: true })
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warning:**

When using `enableRenderBeforeReady: true`, do **not** access features that depend on tasks being ready:
- ‚ùå Don't call dispatchers that communicate with task threads
- ‚úÖ Safe to render static UI (loading screens, placeholders, etc.)


### Task Synchronization Example

**Render Thread (Main):**
```brightscript
sub init()
    m.framework = new Rotor.Framework({
        tasks: ["DataTask", "NetworkTask"],
        rootNode: m.top,
        readyFieldId: "appReady",
        onReady: sub()
            ' Framework and all tasks are ready
            print "All systems ready!"
        end sub
    })
end sub
```

## Node Pool Configuration

Pre-instantiate SceneGraph nodes to improve runtime rendering performance. The node pool allows you to configure the desired quantity of frequently used node types.

**Supported Node Types:**
- `Group` - Container nodes for grouping widgets
- `Rectangle` - Rectangular shapes and backgrounds
- `Poster` - Image display nodes
- `Label` - Text display nodes

### Node Pool Example

```brightscript
framework = new Rotor.Framework({
    nodePool: [
        { nodeType: "Label", count: 50 },       ' Pre-create 50 labels
        { nodeType: "Rectangle", count: 30 },   ' Pre-create 30 rectangles
        { nodeType: "Poster", count: 20 },      ' Pre-create 20 posters
        { nodeType: "Group", count: 10 }        ' Pre-create 10 groups
    ]
})
```

**Note:** Only the four supported node types (Group, Rectangle, Poster, Label) can be added to the node pool. Custom component types are not supported.

## Plugin Configuration

The framework includes the following default plugins:

- **FieldsPlugin**: Dynamic field expressions and interpolation
- **FontStylePlugin**: Typography configuration
- **FocusPlugin**: Spatial navigation and focus management
- **DispatcherProviderPlugin**: MVI state management integration
- **ObserverPlugin**: Field observation and change callbacks

**Custom Plugins:**

Creating custom plugins is possible, but currently not documented. If you need to create custom plugins, please contact the author for guidance.
