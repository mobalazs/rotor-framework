basicInitialization: |
  ' Minimal
  framework = new Rotor.Framework()

  ' With configuration
  framework = new Rotor.Framework({
      tasks: ["DataTask", "NetworkTask"],
      rootNode: m.top,
      readyFieldId: "appReady",
      onReady: sub()
          print "Framework ready!"
      end sub
  })
taskSynchronization:
  why:
    - "Cross-thread initialization: Ensure task threads ready before render thread proceeds"
    - "State management: Wait for initial state loaded from tasks before rendering"
    - "Predictable startup: Guarantee specific initialization order across threads"
  renderQueue:
    description: "ViewBuilder executes synchronously, but framework uses internal render queue to manage timing with task synchronization"
    keyPoints:
      - "Can call render() immediately after framework instantiation, even before tasks synchronized"
      - "Render calls queued internally and maintain order"
      - "If tasks not synced, render queue waits automatically"
      - "Once all tasks signal ready, framework flushes render queue in order"
      - "onReady callback fires after queue flushed"
  bypassQueue:
    parameter: "{ enableRenderBeforeReady: true }"
    usage: "Pass as last parameter to render() to bypass queue and execute immediately"
    warning: "Do NOT access features that depend on tasks being ready"
    avoid:
      - "Don't call dispatchers that communicate with task threads"
      - "Don't access data requiring task initialization"
      - "Don't use middleware making requests to tasks"
    safe: "Safe to render static UI (loading screens, placeholders, etc.)"
  example: |
    ' Create framework with tasks
    m.framework = new Rotor.Framework({
        tasks: ["DataTask", "NetworkTask"],
        onReady: sub()
            print "Tasks synced, render queue flushed!"
        end sub
    })

    ' Show loading screen immediately (bypasses queue)
    m.framework.render({
        id: "loadingScreen",
        viewModel: ViewModels.LoadingScreen
    }, { enableRenderBeforeReady: true })

    ' This render is queued and waits for tasks
    m.framework.render({
        id: "dataWidget",
        viewModel: ViewModels.DataWidget
    })
  taskExample: |
    ' In DataTask
    sub init()
        ' Initialize task resources
        m.database = initDatabase()

        ' Signal ready
        m.top.rotorSync = {
            type: "TASK_READY",
            taskName: "DataTask"
        }

    - "Group"
    - "Rectangle"

lifecycle:
  - "1. Instantiation: new Rotor.Framework(config)"
  - "2. Subsystem Setup: Builder, I18n service, Animator, DispatcherProvider initialized"
  - "3. Device Info: Device information collected and stored"
  - "4. Plugin Registration: Default and custom plugins registered"
  - "5. Node Pool: Nodes pre-instantiated if configured"
  - "6. Render Queue Active: Any render() calls queued internally"
  - "7. Task Sync (if configured): Framework waits for all tasks to signal ready"
  - "8. Render Queue Flush: All queued render operations execute in order"
  - "9. Ready State: onReady callback invoked, readyFieldId set to true"
  - "10. Normal Operation: Subsequent render() calls execute immediately (no queue delay)"
bestPractices:
  initialization:
    good: "Initialize once in Scene init(). Store in m.global for access."
    avoid: "Don't create multiple framework instances - creates conflicts."
  taskSyncAndRendering:
    default: "Render calls safe immediately after framework creation - queued automatically"
    withOnReady: "Use onReady when you need to run logic after sync completes"
    immediate: "Use enableRenderBeforeReady: true for loading screens (static UI only)"
    note: "Render queue handles timing automatically. Use onReady only for additional logic after sync. Use enableRenderBeforeReady only for static UI."
  nodePool:
    good: "Pre-create frequently used node types based on actual usage"
    avoid: "Don't over-allocate node pool - wastes memory"
    note: "Only Group, Rectangle, Poster, Label supported"
troubleshooting:
  rendersNotAppearing:
    problem: "UI doesn't render when expected"
    cause: "If tasks configured, renders queued until all tasks signal ready"
    solution: "Ensure all tasks send sync signals"
    alternative: "If you don't need task sync, omit tasks configuration"
  onReadyNotFiring:
    problem: "onReady callback never executes"
    cause: "One or more tasks not signaling ready state"
    solution: "Verify all tasks send sync signal: m.top.rotorSync = { type: 'TASK_READY', taskName: 'YourTaskName' }"
  memoryIssues:
    problem: "Application uses too much memory"
    cause: "Node pool too large"
    solution: "Reduce node pool sizes based on actual usage"
frameworkProperties:
  subsystems:
    - "builder: ViewBuilder instance"
    - "i18nService: Internationalization service"
    - "dispatcherProvider: MVI dispatcher provider"
    - "animatorProvider: Animation system"
    - "info: Framework and device info"
  metadata:
    - "name: 'Rotor Framework'"
    - "version: '0.2.7'"
  other:
    - "config: Current configuration"
    - "threadType: Rotor.Const.ThreadType.RENDER"
rules:
  - "Initialize framework once in Scene init()"
  - "Access framework via m.global for global access"
  - "Use tasks configuration for task synchronization"
  - "Render calls are queued automatically until tasks ready"
  - "Use enableRenderBeforeReady: true only for static UI (loading screens)"
  - "Don't use task features (dispatchers, task data) with enableRenderBeforeReady"
  - "Use node pool for frequently created nodes only (Group, Rectangle, Poster, Label)"
  - "Don't over-allocate node pool - wastes memory"
  - "Default plugins automatically included"
  - "Custom plugins not documented - contact author if needed"
pitfalls:
  - "Creating multiple framework instances causes conflicts"
  - "Forgetting to send task ready signals causes render queue to wait indefinitely"
  - "Using task features with enableRenderBeforeReady causes errors"
  - "Over-allocating node pool wastes memory"
  - "Using unsupported node types in node pool (only 4 types supported)"
